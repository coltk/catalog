# Course Description Customizations

These tweaks will allow you to customize the course description in a Catalog listing.

You will need to add the `html` content from `listing.html` this will give you the ability to alter the jumbotron and course description as shown in the screenshots below.

You will need to edit the fields in the `listing.html` file to make the content match what you would like in the listing. Please also update all the links for images and external paths over `https`.
