# Change Text within account registration in Catalog

This script will allow you to change the `Already have an account? Sign In!` text to alter the first part of the paragraph, while keeping the original URL for `Sign In!`

`find_text` will be looking for the text to be replaced.
`replace_text` will replace the text from `find_text` and replace it with the value in `replace_text`.
