# Branding Catalog
This folder contains some example CSS & JS files that can be user to give your Catalog instance additional functionality and alter looks.

# Installation
To use custom CSS or JS, you will need to navigate to your admin panel within Catalog. Within your admin page, you will select Catalogs, then select the root Catalog (or select a sub-Catalog) and select the Customization tab.

You will have the ability to copy and paste the raw CSS & JS in the appropriate box, or you can supply a URL that is hosted on a secure server (HTTPS) that points to your override files. Once the CSS and/or JS has been added, click the save button in the top right corner of the page.
