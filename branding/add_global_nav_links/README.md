# Add Global Navigation links

This tweak will allow you to add additional links next to your name/login link.

Within the JavaScript file, you will want to alter the display text in the file as `Link 1-4`.
You will want to edit the links to redirect the links from `https://google.com` to your own link.
These links will open in a new tab, if you would like them to open in the current tab. Remove `'_blank'` from each `<a>` tag.

You will need to add both the JS & CSS file to your Catalog customizations to make the tweaks work.
